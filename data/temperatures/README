For simplicity, we work with daily maximum / minimum temperature measurements, from CHMU.
Those must be stored in the "[STA]-{min,max}.csv" format.

Instead of the Czech column names, inject the English translation:
Year;Month;Day;Value;Tag

From those, we generate a synthetic hourly dataset, assuming attaining those extreme values at:
- 5:00 - lowest temperature
- 15:00 - highest temperature
and linear interpolation. This dataset is generated using generate.ipynb.
